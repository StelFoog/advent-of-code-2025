# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions to Advent of Code 2025 using TypeScript and Bun.

<sub><sup>Project was bootstaped using `create-aoc-tasks`.</sup></sub>

## Managing tasks

Tasks are stored in the format of `day-task.ts` within the tasks folder, e.g. for day 12 task 1 the file would be `tasks/12-1.ts`.

`bun make-day [day]` can be used to automatically create task and input files for the provided day. If an `AOC_SESSION` variable is provided into `.env` your input will also be fetched.

## Running

Install dependencies: `bun install`

Any task can be run using `bun task` which by default runs the last task (can also be done explicitly with `bun task latest`). Alternativly a day `bun task [day]` (which will try to run part 2 first and part 1 secondly), or a specific task (`bun task [day-part]`).

Tasks try to get input specific to that day (e.g for task `4-1`, it will get `inputs/4.txt`) or, if it doesn't exist, the default input (`inputs/default.txt`).

It's also possible to use example inputs by including `true` after the task to be run (e.g. `bun task latest true`), which work the same as regular inputs, but placed within the `example.txt` file in the inputs folder.
